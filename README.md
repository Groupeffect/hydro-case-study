# hydro-case-study
Graph application with hydrologic datasets
 The goal is to chain different open source technologies and connect datasets for reusable methods, furthermore it can be used as playground for data aquisition and data mining with rdf standards.
 Main features are:
 - database schema for hydrologic / geospatial datasets e.g. [ https://www.hydrosheds.org/, https://www.usgs.gov/ ]
 - django REST-Api for communication and processes between services. Provides multiple data representations and CRUD methods.
 - enrichment of relational datasets with ontological methods
 - docker integration
 - documentation
